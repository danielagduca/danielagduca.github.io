This series of paintings is an exploration of the world of social media and the effect it has on our bodies and how we view our bodies, especially as women – via figurative art. We all know what is happening: retouched images with a variety of filters are being posted on Facebook, instagram and the like. These are not necessarily of celebrities, that’s what makes the whole issue even more scary. As you look at them, you may think, oh, this is how this girl looks like. And as a young woman, or a woman of any age, you are driven into depression for not being up to the standards; or you are driven to the surgical room for a botox injection. In these paintings, I explore the danger of our bodies becoming so commercial that we resort to surgical interventions and computerised add-ons to continue believing in their genuine beauty and usefulness.
