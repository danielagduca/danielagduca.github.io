The painting is really a collage of fruit and veg packaging, I could not get it why there was so much in the stores.

The sculpture - a Christmas Tree for the lockdown season - was the most zen experience of 2020. I built it with plastic water bottle caps, and decorated it using classic and fluid acrylics. Check my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/acrazyyellowtheory/) for the process.
