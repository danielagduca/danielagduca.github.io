I got into painting digitally because I had no more space to store the paintings I was creating. Back in 2018/9, I would just draw and paint whenever I was waiting for something. So many of my digitals started on my commute. And the most recent ones from 2020, are still about my commute, but without me being there:

I also jotted down in a kid-like approach the paintings I'd come across while visiting museums, or developing some ideas on a variety of topics.

On my instagram account [acrazyyellowtheory](https://www.instagram.com/acrazyyellowtheory/) you can find more work in progress versions of my digital paintings, but here's one of them.

These days, I try to use the digital process to improve my painting skills!
