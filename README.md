I am a self-taught artist and a tech product manager based in London. In my creative world, I am ruminating on one particular mood expressed by the color of yellow. What is yellow? and what objects are yellow around me? I find myself drawn to the this colour because of its purity. Yellow cannot be created from any other colours. It is a primary colour in the standard model colour wheel and a primary hue in the less known painter’s colour wheel (CMY). Yellow juxtaposes two sides. On the one side, yellow is a colour that inspires happiness and positive energy – think sunlight and the sand on the beach. On the other side, it is often used to caution us against looming danger, think traffic signs, construction signs, and electric cupboards. In my recent paintings, I explore this duality. I work mainly in acrylics and experiment with a few other media.
