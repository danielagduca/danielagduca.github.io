> This post originally appeared on [SAGE Ocean](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/2018/9/28/39-women-doing-amazing-research-in-computational-social-science)

Three months ago, I embarked on a new product manager role within [SAGE Ocean](https://ocean.sagepub.com/), an initiative that supports social scientists to do better and more computational research. I had an idea of what that entailed, but like any new starter, I began exploring and organizing my knowledge in notes and mind maps. I was surprised and terrified when, one day, I discovered that all the research and researchers that I explored were men. Nothing bad about that, but I wondered where are the women in computational social science and why I did not come across them on my learning journey. 

I set out to find them! And I want to share with you this list of 39 female researchers that I was quite impressed with. They are all crushing it in the social sciences and humanities with their innovative use of computational methods and very cool explorations of cutting edge tech. Follow them, read their papers and collaborate!
