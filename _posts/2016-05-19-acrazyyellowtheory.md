In a chaotic time, I sit in my studio flat. I try to relax. Itâ€™s been a long day at work. Loads of projects. Loads of people. Everyone wants some attention. So I paint. I paint a theory. A theory of the world. The world I want to live in. The world that could be evolving.

And then I reflect. There are 3 things the world cared about. Nature. Nurture. And Art.

Nature is under stress. Climate change.

Nurture is under stress. Media and divorce.

Art has always been about sensationalism. And we are all changing that.

And now imagine a theory. A crazy theory where everything is yellow. Everything is happy and awesome. There is no stress and there are no worries. In that world, our hearts might look something like this.
