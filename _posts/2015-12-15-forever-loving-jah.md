**Note:** Honorable mention at the MacKnight Black Poetry Competition in 2009.

*The following poem is the creed of a Rastafarian. It is written in Caribbean creole English and has 108 lines divided in 12 stanzas, each having 9 lines. All numbers represent the integrity of Jah (God, Buddha, Dumnezeu etc.). For instance 108 adds up to 9 which is the ideal number. Also, 108 contains “0” in the middle, which represents the circular and all-encompassing nature of Jah. 12 adds to 3, and 9 is a multiple of 3. The language used has a specific meaning. Always use first person personal pronoun such as “I n I” (instead of “I”) or “I” (instead of  “me” or “my”). Words that usually represent concepts would have “I” incorporated, some verbs are fused. (“Irie” – “I man free” or I am a free man; “I aan n I a knacka” – I am here and I have a good heart/soul/spirit)*

# I n I forever loving Jah

###### a Rastafarian’s creed

The day king Solomon was here
Is far away and ever near
He had a son as bright as him
Who had a son, who had a son
Who had another son, who had a son
Until 225th was king
As Garvey n dem said,
He was d Black Messiah,
D Creator Head.
 

Oh Jah if only I n I had known
That I is true descendant of d throne
That I n I can be a king
An emperor or vagrant
Have any type of work that’s known
But all d same live under Jah I blessin
Then I n I won’t go no war jus so
But come together as a whole
For Jah to thank, true heart n soul


I n I forever loving Jah
In times of illness, trouble or desire
It’s d I-losophy I’m living by
Praising H.I.M. Sellassie I
Negus Negusti, King of kings
D one who brings us igher n igher
Back to Africa d mother land
Someday will I n I be der
Oh Jah, please hear my prayer


D time has come for me to say
Jah der will come that day
When u embrace our eartt and nation
And stop the suffering to bring salvation
I know that day is far away
Or maybe is about to happen
We r same people n we waitin
Rastafari Jah ever livin n
Spreadin our love n blessin
 

I tank u Jah that u exist
And pray we come as one Jah is
Rejoice ur greatness n ignite
The love n hope in I n I
Feel free in dis world full of fear
N have d courage to go down
And burn dat Babylon one time aroun
Jah is Jah is Irator Jah is d might
So then let us all “get together and feel all right”
 

I life is lovin life
I life is blessin life
I live in accordance under Jah
I love, I pray, I eat
I man for soul, I mind and body
I love n purity comes from within
Its sacred instinct born in Jahselfin
From ooman’s womb when I a baby
That how I have dreadlocks, n for d fight I ready


I am what I am since creation
And vibes within I is givin me liberation
No one can touch them
No one can interfere
No one can disturb
I will still spread d lovin
N I will still carry blessin n be heard
Righteousness, justice n equality
I man, Jah is, Irie
 

Livity is happiness
But d happiness don’t come from out
Happiness come from within
Jah is one grace, one happiness, one freedom
Therefore Jah is, Jah is inside
N u cud try n find a place to hide
But that not possible in any way
Coz Jah is everywhere u say
So only ting to do is pray
 

D more you look
D less u see
D quickness of ur eyes dey say
It does deceive ur body but
Ur mind in power comes
Together with d soul will i-talize ur strength
And bring back reason
To apprecilove d piipl and not hate
Coz Jah is everywhere Jah is great
 

We r d devils
We do d wrong tings
We enslaved d animals and call dem pets
We say dog man best friend
But did dog ever agree us to befriend?
I now try this to higherstand
Why man dis Devilon expand
But same time say ‘In God we truss’
It sound all for material lusst
 

But Jah is Jah is everywhere
And even if u flee from Jah
U fin soon nuff that Jah is der
So all me bredren n sistren
Go deh know Jah is and give tanks
N let d reggae music guide ur ranks
Biko “one love is one heart
We’ll get together
N feel all right”
 

I kno I kno I kno
Jah is I aan n I a knacka (I am here and my heart is good)
Love, purity and blessin
“now xcuse me while I light my splif
Oh Jah I got to take a lif
From d reality I jus cant drif
That’s y im stayin wit dis splif”
“Get to my herbal meditation
N smoke dis holy medication” —- more time!
