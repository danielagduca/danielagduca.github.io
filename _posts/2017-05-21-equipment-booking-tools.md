You may be surprised to hear it, but booking systems for research equipment are not really that scary. Better still, they’re also not that rare anymore. We found a number of institutions making really good use of these systems, so we looked more closely at what data they were collecting and how.

Most importantly, we found out that booking systems for research equipment have been refined over the past few years to deal with issues about anything from ‘each piece of kit is different’ to ‘we have different charges for different types of users’, and so on.

## Everyone is responsible for updating the booking system

It is definitely worth mentioning that all the booking systems I’ve had a chance to engage with are very flexible and dynamic, so one can always change the time slots, the blackout periods, the charging options, the privacy and availability settings.

Improvements have all been driven by users, which is different from central databases that may collate equipment across an institution once (or max once a year), but have no information on how much this equipment is being used, or even if it’s been moved or sold. As a bonus, they are all pretty much free for the end user.

There is also no need to have one person going around to all the departments and trying to collate information about research equipment; instead this task is shared by the individuals responsible for a piece of equipment, be it the lab technician or the person that got the equipment as part of a grant. They also have the incentive to keep this information up to date because it allows them to see how much time they have available to offer the equipment to other users.

As we are starting to work with five of them, I thought I’d give you a summary of the features they have. But before we get into the reviews, I have one request to make.

If you’re using a system to let-out or book research equipment that isn’t covered below, please do let me know. We are looking to work with as many of these systems as possible and standardise a few commonly-used fields and indicators that would help researchers, universities and research-funders to understand equipment usage and where costs could be saved.

Ok, let’s look more closely at the systems we surveyed.

## Academican

#### Overview:

[Academican](http://academican.org/) was established about five years ago at the University of Surrey. It has been run quite successfully since then by Peter Wilson and recently revamped. It has a slick interface and you can sign up with your .ac.uk address and to access to your institutional equipment (if it’s on there), and anything else that is public or you have been approved to view. If you manage any pieces of kit, you can add them to academican.org quite easily, and you have a variety of options: you can offer it as a service or share times it’s available to book. Flexible fields allow you to specify more than just a description and a picture of the equipment. You can also link any publications, projects and data sets related to the piece of kit.

## QReserve

#### Overview:

[QReserve](https://www.qreserve.com/) was built by researchers at Canada’s McMaster University about 3 years ago, with a main aim of sharing equipment across Canada and worldwide. Since then, Brandon Aubie and his team have realised that the only way to keep the equipment information up to date is with a lab management service, because “it helps to know that there is a microscope, but also that it is available next Tuesday”. They have an [overarching presence internationally](https://www.qreserve.com/map/unique), with at least 16 different organisations using QReserve in the UK.

The web-based system allows users to catalogue and visualise their key lab equipment on fully customisable floor plans, and like the other systems handles complex booking and hiring, both within an institution and with external collaborators and customers. ULAB integrates with your PURE current research information system.

#### Pricing:

Free for the end user and anyone can register. ULAB is working with a number of institutions to establish the business model, but institutional accounts with a number of extra features (including advanced reporting across the organisation) would be available via joining the membership consortium, an annual subscription fee will be negotiable.
