https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/2018/10/8/womentofollow-in-computational-social-science?rq=daniela%20duca



A little over a week ago, I posted a blog celebrating 39 women in computational social science. We knew there would be so many more amazing researchers to add, and the social science community duly delivered, suggesting plenty of women that should also be celebrated. Therefore, rather fittingly on [#AdaLovelaceDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdaLovelaceDay?src=tren&data_id=tweet%3A1049574990209867776) we have  published an updated list. The number has now more than doubled, and we hope that it is a good start for anyone looking for a supervisor for their PhD, or just wanting to see what other doctoral fellows are working on.

There are, of course, hundreds, if not thousands more female researchers either working on their PhD, already advanced in their careers as academics, or carrying out computational research work with societal data within non-profits and other private organisations. And there are even more men, whose remarkable outputs and contributions in this field are similarly critical. We invite you to use this as a start, and comment or tweet any other researchers that you know in this space. At SAGE Ocean, we believe that social science has a critical role to play in shaping the future of society for the better and that researchers sit at the foundation of this. Read more about our mission and goals and how we could help you [here](https://ocean.sagepub.com/).

We realize, that our coverage here is still quite limited to the US, UK and some in Europe and even fewer in Asia and currently none from Africa. We reached out to the computational social science group in Africa and hoping for further insight into the CSS researchers in this region. So watch this space!
