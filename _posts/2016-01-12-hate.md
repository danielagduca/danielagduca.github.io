Lead runs through your veins
Instead of neurons you have chains
your clothes are dirty with hydrogen
your soul so cold, it fries in liquid nitrogen.
You sleep on 7 pillows
and your brow never furrows
but that of your friend does
and it gives you such a buzz.
Now you’re making a new world order
which creates only disorder
as you kill all light today
and with the same pleasure you still dismay
all those that forgot about you
and you come in their dreams to imbue
with the lead from your veins
and your mind of heavy chains.
You let them smell you dirty clothes
and you leave them to wake up
thinking you’re one of their heroes.
