Allow me
The king of social media
To tell you
What’s right and wrong
In this world.

Allow me
The King of social media
To tell you
What to think
About politics and pop stars.

Allow me
The King of social media
To tell you
Who to follow, because I know
Who is loudest.

Allow me
The King of social media
To tell you
How boring you are
And how cool I am.

Allow me
The King of social media
To tell you
What to do
With your life.

Allow me
The King of social media
To tell you
How to be happy…

Who am I?
You are asking ME
Who I am?

I am THE KING
of SoCiAL MeDIa.
