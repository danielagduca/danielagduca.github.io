Smile,
Smile more,
Smile at everyone,
Smile a lot even if it’s not sunny.

Laugh,
Laugh more,
Laugh at anything,
Laugh at every joke even if it’s not funny.

Feel,
Feel more,
Feel everything,
Feel all the pain as if it’s just honey.

Admire,
Admire more,
Admire every movement of every bus and every train,
Close your eyes and hear the sound of the waves,
Close your eyes and imagine the top of a mountain.
