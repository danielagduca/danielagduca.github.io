Last Friday was incredible. It was beyond my expectations. Thank you all for coming and contributing to an unforgettable opening night for my first solo exhibit. And thank you to Lacey Contemporary Gallery for hosting. Here are some pictures from the crazy yellow theory exhibit (courtesy of my dad and [@imaginativephotoworks](https://www.instagram.com/imaginativephotoworks/)).

Over the next few weeks, I will be reflecting back on this experience and sharing some of the lessons I learned. So watch this space.

If you liked any of the paintings and want to tell me which ones, or buy any, do get in touch.
